## About

This repository contains my personal solutions to various **Codeforces** problems.  

It serves as:
- A practice log for competitive programming  
- A reference for algorithms and data structures  
- A way to track my progress in problem-solving  

All solutions are implemented in **Java**, focusing on clean, efficient, and contest-ready code.

````

- Each folder under `src/` corresponds to a Codeforces **Round ID**.  
- Inside each contest folder, the problems are named after their problem codes (A, B, C, etc.).  
- Example: `src/Round99/Problem_123A.java` is the solution for Problem 123A(problem code) of Round 99.
